            Some HTML elements are self-closing. They 
            kinda do their own thing without an argument.

            The easiest one is the <b>line break</b>, or 
            <i>br/</i>.
        <br/>
            Strangely enough, lines are capped at 80 
            characters, but if we want a hard line 
            break, this is the use of it.
        <br/>
            That being said, line break should not be 
            stacked. That's the job of CSS.       
    </p>

    <p class="text-container">
        The <i>hr/</i> tag is for "horizontal rule", or 
        a thematic break.

        <hr/>

        Looks like this!
