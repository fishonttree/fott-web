                CSS content can be done in a <b>separate</b>
                file, in which we give the head element a <i>link</i> 
                tag, giving the <i>rel</i> attribute (relation) the value
                <i>"stylesheet"</i> and the <i>href</i> attribute for
                where the CSS ile is located relative to the HTML file. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Or we can do it on the same file, stuffing all of the 
                properties in a <i>style</i> tag within the <i>head</i> tag.
            </p>

            <p>
                One's useful for setting <b>common</b>
                style properties between multiple pages, and one 
                is for unique style properties of particular pages.
            </p>

            <p>
                The third one, which isn't very useful, is typing the CSS 
                attribute right on the HTML line (<b>inline</b>).
                It can get messy very quickly.

                CSS syntax runs by selectors
                and semi-colon separated list
                of declarations - each of them
                being a property:value pair.
            </p>

        <div class="subsection-title">
            <h2>
                Selectors
            </h2>
        </div>

        <div class="green text">
            <p>
                The <i>"*"</i> (<b>universal</b>) selector tells us
                the property applied to all elements.
            </p>

            <p>
                The <b>type</b> selector select specific
                elements to affect.                
            </p>

            <p>
                Note that the <i>&ltdiv&gt</i> is a
                basic HTML element being an empty
                container. Of course, we want elements
                that actually do something - but we can 
                run with this one in the meantime.
            </p>


            <p>
                The <b>class</b> selector select elements
                by the class attribute given by you. Picking
                a element in a class can be done with a period
                ("."). Multiple classes can be assigned to an
                element. Just remember to select all of them to
                actually pick the element.
            </p>

            <p>
                The <b>ID</b> selector works like the class
                selector, but an element can only have <b>one</b>
                ID. Picking an element of an ID can be done 
                with a <i>"#"</i>.
            </p>

            <p>
                Class and ID selectors can be <b>chained</b> with each
                and one another (note that chaining doesn't work on more
                than one type selector). They can also be <b>grouped</b>
                together should they share similar style declarations.
            </p>

            <p>
                Note that the chaining syntax is connected, while 
                the grouping syntax is with line break.
            </p>

        </div>

        <div class="red text">
            <p>
                This is a text assigned the classees <i>red</i>
                and <i>text</i> (red text). The one above is assigned 
                <i>green</i> and <i>text.</i>
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="ancestor">
            <div class="descendent">
                <p> To used classes in a hierarchal manner, consider 
                nesting them (indent as usual). Now, selecting them
                would require whitespace between each selection.
                Remember, there's a healthy level of nesting!
                </p>

                <p> These texts are of the ancestor class "ancestor"
                    (I know, very creative) and the descendent class
                    "descendent" (very creative, in fact).
                </p>

                <p> Note that descendents can be directly targeted 
                    by using <i>.ancestor > .descendent</i> in CSS.
                </p>
            </div>

        <div class="subsection-title">
            <h2>Basics CSS Properties</h2>
        </div>

        <div class="text">
            <p>We can give elements <b>color</b> and
            <b>background-color...</b> The <i>transparent</i>
            keyword exists, by the way. No idea what it's for.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="fonted-text">
            <p>The <b>font-family</b> property points out the 
            single value / comma-separated list of values.
            Each one is either a "font family name" (e.g
            "Times New Roman" - the quotes is for containing
            the spaces) or a "generic family name" (e.g sans-serif
            - generic family names don't use quotes).
            </p>

            <p>
                It's generally good practice to have a list of 
                fonts, by order of how much we want it up and running,
                because in the event that the font is <b>not
                supported</b>, we're gonna need fallback options.
            </p>

            <p>
                The <b>font-size</b> property will give its size in
                <b>px</b> (pixels). The number and the unit should <b>not</b>
                have whitespaces between them.
            </p>

            <p>
                You can notice the bigger text, right?
            </p>

            <p>
                The <b>font-weight</b> gives how bold the text will
                be. It can either be a number or a keyword (e.g bold).
            </p>

            <p>
                Typically, then number is by hundred increment, between
                100 and 900 (within 1 and 1000).
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="aligned-text">
            <p>
                The text can also be given a <b>text-align</b>, through the use 
                of keywords.
            </p>
        </div>


        <div class="subsection-title">
            <h2>Images</h2>
        </div>
        
        <div class="fonted-text">
            <p>Images can be adjusted for <b>height</b> and <b>width</b>,
            through the keyword <i>auto</i> for it to automatically scale
            with the other dimension (in px). This is, if you don't want
            to make it disproportionate for the funni.

        <div class="green text">
            <p>
                Images can be selected in CSS like a class,
                but <b>without the period</b>
            </p>

            <p>
                It's generally good practice to include the 
                height and width, so that the image doesn't
                load slower and also prevents it from weirdly
                shifting the display.
