        <h1>Homepage</h1>

        <p>
            As you see, the link below has the href
            attribute and is marked as linked.
        </p>

        <p>
            The link is also absolute - goes to
            pages on other websites.
        </p>

        <p>
            The target attribute points where the
            linked resource will be opened. Without
            it, the default value is <i>self</i>, thereby
            opening in the current tab. Putting
            <i>_blank</i> as the value will open the link 
            in a new window.
        </p>

        <p>
            Absolute links take the <i>protocol://domain/path</i>
            structure.
        </p>

        <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">click me</a>

        <p>
            Now, relative links go to other pages
            on the same website. The domain name is
            assumed to be the same as the page 
            where the link is placed.
        </p>

        <a href="pages/about.html">About</a>

        <p>
            There's an image below. Image elements are 
            <i>self-closing</i>, and take the <i>src</i> (source) 
            attribute to retrieve where the image file
            is located.
        </p>
        
        <img src="https://gumlet.assettype.com/afkgaming%2Fimport%2Fmedia%2Fimages%2F55143-08bf98e6a4535406acafc015adf99434.jpeg?compress=true&dpr=1&w=1200">

        <p>
            An image can also be picked from the
            directory where the files are held.
        </p>

        <img src="./images/kek-laugh.jpeg" alt="The KEKW Laugh">

        <p>
            Images must also have an <i>alt</i> (alternative)
            attribute for describing it in the event
            that the reader somehow can't read it.

        </p>

        <h1>Hey there!</h1>

        <h2>That, up there, was a big heading.</h2>

        <h3>This one, however, is smaller</h3>

        <h6>All the way to heading 6, very small.</h6>

        <h2>Headings are bigger and bolder
            than the other text elements.
        </h2>

        <p>
            Some random words in a paragraph,
            to remind you that line break in
            the HTML file will not make a
            line break in the actual website.
        </p>

        <p>However, making a new paragraph
            element will.
        </p>

        <h2>
            We now move on.
        </h2>

        <strong>
            This a strong element. Bold and
            important.
        </strong>

        <p>
            Or snugged in the middle of other
            elements like <strong>this</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
            Elements can also be <em>emphasized
            </em> like this.
        </p>

        <p>
            Elements can be made <b> bold</b>
        </p>

        <p>
            Or <i>italicized</i>.
        </p>

        <p>
            Now, while <b>bold</b> and <i>italicized
            </i> text do what they do anywhere
            else, <strong>strong</strong> and
            <em>emphasized</em> are for
            changing verbal quality of the
            text upon being read - this
            will actually be registered by
            technologies like screen readers.
        </p>

        <p>
            This is a <sub>subscript</sub> element
            while this is a <sup>supercript</sup>
            element. Funny.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            This is a <mark>marked</mark> text,
            this is a <small>small</small> text,
            this is a <del>deleted</del> text, and
            this is an <ins>inserted</ins> text.

        </p>

        <h2>
            Some side remarks:
        </h2>

        <p>
            Lorem ipsum can be used to create
            dummy text. It is nonsensical Latin
            to demonstrate what the text does
            without typing any actual meaning.
        </p>

        <h2>
            These are all child elements to
            the body of the website. These
            are siblings with each other.
            Indentation is used as good practice
            for indication.
